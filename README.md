# delete-tweets
Delete your tweets after 24 hours

This program deletes any tweets you've posted daily at 2AM CST.

I think tweets should be more ephemeral than they are, so this makes them that way.

# Resources

Uses <a href="https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy">Tweepy</a>, a Python library for Twitter API. Install it with: 

```

pip install tweepy


```

# @ToDo

Write code to delete user's tweets on a regular basis. Host on Firebase with a login for authentication?
